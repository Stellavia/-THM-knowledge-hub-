## 🏷️ **Topic:** Learn about network security, understand attack methodology, and practice hacking into a target server. ##

# 📚 Study Notes #


## Learning Objectives ##
- learn what is network security and its purpose
- what is CIA triad
- difference between HW and SW based security solution
- what is firewall, IDS, IPS, VPN concentrator
- and many more things ... 

### Introduction ###
- A computer network **is a group of connected computers and devices**.
- Network security focuses on protecting these devices, the connections between them, and the data they carry by ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA).

- Network security is achieved using **hardware and software solutions**:
  - **Hardware security solutions** (*these are physical devices used to protect networks*): **firewall appliance** (*controls incoming and outgoing traffic using predefined rules*), 
**IDS** (*Intrusion Detection System*, *detects attacks or intrusion attempts*), **IPS** (*Intrusion Prevention System*, *detects and actively blocks attacks*), **VPN concentrator** (*encrypts network traffic to protect data confidentiality and integrity*).

  - **Software security solutions** (*these are programs installed on systems*): **Antivirus software** (*detects and blocks malicious files*), **host firewall** (*software-based firewalls built into operating systems, e.g. Windows Defender Firewall, macOS firewall*). 

### Why network security matters ###

- Data breaches are extremely costly. According to IBM Security:

    - Average breach cost (2021): $4.24 million
    - Healthcare sector: ~$9.23 million
    - Education sector: ~$3.79 million

><details><summary>❓What type of firewall is Windows Defender Firewall?</summary>Host Firewall</details>
>Solution: It runs on your computer and protects only that device, not the whole network.

><details><summary>❓During which step of the Cyber Kill Chain does the attacker gather information about the target</summary>Recon</details>
>Solution: The attacker gathers info about the target before launching the attack, which is first step

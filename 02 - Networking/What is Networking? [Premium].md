## What is Networking?

- At its most basic level, a network is simply things that are connected.

- A helpful way to think about this is through everyday examples, such as a friendship group, where people are connected by shared interests, activities, or goals.

-Networks exist everywhere, not just in computing. 
- For example:
    - A city’s public transportation system
    - National electricity and power grids
    - Postal systems for sending letters and parcels
    - Social interactions, such as meeting and greeting neighbours

- All of these systems involve connected entities working together to share resources or information.

- In computing, networking follows the same concept but applies it to technological devices.

- Examples of networked devices include laptops and smartphones, servers and routers, security cameras and traffic lights, industrial and agricultural systems

- A computer network can consist of as few as two devices or billions of devices connected globally

- Devices are networked so they can communicate, share data, and access resources.

- Networks are deeply integrated into modern life, supporting systems such as weather data collection, power distribution, traffic management or communication and information access

- Because networks underpin so much of today’s infrastructure, understanding networking is essential in cybersecurity. 
- Securing systems requires knowing how devices connect, communicate, and interact.

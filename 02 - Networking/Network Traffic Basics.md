## 🏷️ Learn what network analysis is, why it is essential, how to collect network traffic and which tools are available


# 📚 Study Notes 

&nbsp;

- **Network Traffic Analysis (NTA)** is the process of capturing, inspecting, and analyzing network data as it moves across a network. 
- Its goal is to **provide full visibility into what is happening inside and outside the network**. 
NTA is more than just using tools like Wireshark — it combines log correlation, deep packet inspection, and network flow analysis to achieve specific security goals.

&nbsp;

- NTA involves collecting traffic data, examining packets, reviewing logs, and analyzing network flows to understand communication patterns. 
- Analysts compare normal network behavior (baseline) with unusual activity to detect potential threats. 
- It is a key skill for both blue team (defensive) and red team (offensive) roles, especially for SOC analysts monitoring security events.

- Strong networking fundamentals make NTA much easier to understand.
- Recommended background knowledge: **Pre Security** and **Networking Essentials**.

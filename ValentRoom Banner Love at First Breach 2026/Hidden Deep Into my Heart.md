# Initial Recon

I started with basic web enumeration against the target service on port 5000.

## Directory Enumeration 

I used GOBUSTER to brute force common directories and files, syntax: `gobuster dir -u http://TARGET_IP:5000/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt` 
The outcome:<br>
  /robots (JACKPOT!)<br>
  /console (returned 400 which indicates route exists)

# robots.txt Discovery

Hence, I fetched robots file with command: `curl http://TARGET_IP:5000/robots.txt`
Inside the .txt file I found some data that I understood as a password into the mentioned "hidden" directory (bare with me).

# Manually request the hidden path

curl -i http://TARGET_IP:5000/HIDDEN_DIRECTORY_NAME/

Afterwards server returned the HTML with secret message:

<title>HIDDEN_DIRECTORY_NAMe</title>
"You've found the secret HIDDEN_DIRECTORY_NAME, but there's more to discover..."

# I TRIED and I FAILED MANY TIMES

- admin login endpoint with curl POST requests: curl -s -X POST http://TARGET_IP:5000/cupids_secret_vault/administrator -d "username=test&password=test" | wc -c
- tried robots.txt pwd
- tried alternate usernames
- tried SQL injection payloads
- tried auth header tests

# Then I decided to STOP COMPLICATING my life

I went back into the browser, changed the URL, logged into the secret directory and got flag.

# Conclusion

**Sometimes, it’s best to just stick to the simplest path.**

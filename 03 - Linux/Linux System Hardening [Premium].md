## Physical Security ##

- Physical security is the **first layer of defense**.
- If an attacker can access your computer physically, they can steal disks or reset passwords, even on Linux.
- This is why the saying goes: **“boot access = root access.”**

- **To protect your system**:
  - Keep computers in **secure locations**.
  - Use complex system passwords.
  - For personal systems, consider adding a BIOS/UEFI boot password.
  - You can also **add a GRUB password** to **prevent unauthorized boot changes** or **root access** (`grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 `generates the hash).

&nbsp;

>[!WARNING]
>**GRUB passwords aren’t useful for cloud servers**, since you can’t access the physical machine.

&nbsp;

- Physical security is crucial because attackers with physical access can cause serious damage. 
- GRUB passwords and boot passwords add extra layers, but you should also have a plan if disks are stolen.  

&nbsp;

>[!NOTE]
> - **GRUB** [The GRand Unified Bootloader] **is a program that starts your Linux system when you turn on your computer**. It lets you **choose which operating system to boot** and can be used to access advanced boot options.

&nbsp;

---

><details><summary>❓ What command can you use to create a password for the GRUB bootloader?</summary>grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2</details>
**Solution**: It's a tool that creates a secure password hash for GRUB, so only authorized users can change boot settings or access root.

&nbsp;

## Filesystem Partitioning and Encryption ##

- Disk **encryption protects data** if a device is stolen or physically accessed.
- Encrypted data is unreadable without the correct password, making the disk useless to attackers.

- Most Linux systems use **LUKS** [Linux Unified Key Setup] for disk encryption.
- LUKS **encrypts a partition** using a **master key**, which is protected by one or more user passwords = this allows multiple users to unlock the same encrypted disk with different passwords.
- LUKS supports strong encryption algorithms and securely derives keys from passwords using **PBKDF2** = The actual data on the disk is encrypted with the master key.

&nbsp;

>[!NOTE]
> - **LUKS** [Linux Unified Key Setup] is a tool that **encrypts Linux disks** so data can’t be read without a password.
>
> - **PBKDF2** is a **method** that **turns a password into a strong encryption key**.
>
> - **Cryptsetup** is a **command-line tool** to set up and manage encrypted Linux partitions.
  
&nbsp;

- Linux distributions usually provide a graphical way to encrypt disks, but encryption can also be set up from the command line using **cryptsetup**. Once encrypted, the partition must be unlocked, formatted, and mounted before use.

- **Encryption is an essential layer of security**, especially to protect data if disks or devices are stolen.

## Firewall ##

- A firewall **controls** which **network traffic** can enter or leave a system, **protecting** it from attacks.
- On Linux, firewalls are usually host-based, meaning they protect a single system, and they work by controlling traffic based on ports rather than processes.

### Key points ###
- **Purpose**: Block unauthorized access, prevent clients from acting as servers, and control network traffic.
- **Linux firewalls**: Modern Linux firewalls are stateful, tracking ongoing connections for better security.
- **Netfilter**: The core packet-filtering system in the Linux kernel. Front-ends like iptables and nftables let you manage rules (**iptables** uses chains: INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD to allow or block traffic amd **nftables** is newer, more efficient, and also controls traffic through tables and chains).
- **Simpler tools**: Front-ends like **UFW** [Uncomplicated Firewall] make firewall setup easier. e.g. `ufw allow 22/tcp` allows SSH traffic.
- **Firewall policy**: Decide whether to block all and allow exceptions (safer) or allow all and block exceptions (more convenient).

&nbsp;

>[!NOTE]
> - **iptables** – A Linux tool to set firewall rules for controlling network traffic using netfilter.
>
> - **nftables** – A modern Linux firewall tool that manages traffic more efficiently than iptables.
>   
> - **UFW** – “Uncomplicated Firewall,” a simple tool to allow or block network traffic on Linux.

&nbsp;

>[!CAUTION]
>**Firewalls are essential for Linux security, but rules must be planned carefully, especially as exceptions grow.**

><details><summary>❓What is the allowed UDP port?</summary>14298</details>
**Solution**: It's in the previous output.

&nbsp;

## Remote Access ##

- Remote access lets you control a system from anywhere, but it also **exposes the system to attacks** like ***password sniffing***, guessing, or ***exploiting services***.

### Key protections ###
- **Use encrypted protocols** (e.g., SSH) instead of cleartext ones like Telnet.
- **Prevent password guessing** by **disabling root login** (`PermitRootLogin no`) and by using strong passwords or, better, public key authentication.
- **Set up SSH keys** by generating keys with `ssh-keygen -t rsa` and copy the public key to the server with `ssh-copy-id username@server`.
- Configure SSH server (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) to **enable key authentication** (`PubkeyAuthentication yes`) and **disable password login** (`PasswordAuthentication no`).

&nbsp;

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> **Using SSH keys instead of passwords makes remote access secure and reduces the risk of attackers guessing credentials.**

&nbsp;

>[!NOTE]
> - **SSH** – A secure protocol for remote login and file transfer on Linux.
>
> - **ssh-keygen** – A tool that creates a public/private key pair for secure SSH access.
>
> - **ssh-copy-id** – A command that copies your SSH public key to a server for passwordless login.

&nbsp;

---

><details><summary>❓What flag is hidden in the sshd_config file?  </summary>THM{******_***_*****}</details>
**Solution**: Use command: `cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

&nbsp;

## Securing User Accounts ##

- The root account has full control over the system and should not be used for everyday work. Mistakes made as root can easily break the system.

<img width="444" height="241" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a011830c-255f-4ffd-b7d9-5c3d460bca83" />

&nbsp;

### Best practices ###

  - **Use sudo**: Create a normal user for admin tasks and add it to the `sudo` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `wheel` (RedHat/Fedora) group + Use sudo only when root privileges are needed.
  - **Disable root login**: After setting up a sudo user, disable direct root access by setting its shell to `/sbin/nologin`.
  - **Enforce strong passwords**: Use `libpwquality` to require longer, more complex passwords and prevent password reuse.
  - **Disable unused accounts**: Disable accounts that no longer need access by setting their shell to `/sbin/nologin`. Do the same for service accounts (e.g., `www-data`, `nginx`) to prevent interactive logins if compromised.

&nbsp;

>[!IMPORTANT]
> **Limiting root usage, enforcing strong passwords, and disabling unused accounts greatly reduces the risk of system compromise.**

&nbsp;

>[!NOTE]
> - **sudo** – Lets a regular user **run commands with root** (administrative) privileges.
>
> - **sudoers** – A group of users **allowed to use sudo** on a Linux system.
>
> - **/sbin/nologin** – A shell that **prevents** a user or service account **from logging** in interactively. 

&nbsp;

---

><details><summary>❓One way to disable an account is to edit the `passwd` file and change the account’s shell. What is the suggested value to use for the shell?</summary>/sbin/nologin</details>
**Solution**: On Linux, each user account has a login shell defined in the /etc/passwd file. The shell determines what program runs when the user logs in. To disable an account without deleting it, you can change its shell to a special value that prevents interactive logins. This means the user or service cannot open a shell session, effectively disabling their ability to log in while keeping the account intact for system purposes instead of removing the account.

><details><summary>❓What is the name of the RedHat and Fedora systems sudoers group?</summary>wheel</details>

---

><details><summary>❓What is the name of the sudoers group on Debian and Ubuntu systems?</summary>sudo</details>

---

><details><summary>❓Other than tryhackme and ubuntu, what is the username that belongs to the sudoers group?</summary>blacksmith</details>
**Solution**: Run commmand: `cat /etc/group | grep sudo`

---

&nbsp;


## Software and Services ##

- Installing software and running services increases potential security risks.
  
- To reduce your attack surface:
  - **Disable unnecessary services**: Remove or disable software you don’t need, like web servers, to minimize vulnerabilities.
  - **Block unneeded ports**: Adjust your firewall to block network ports for services you don’t use (e.g., block ports 80/443 if no web server).
  - **Avoid legacy protocol**: Use secure alternatives (e.g., SSH instead of Telnet, SFTP instead of TFTP) because old network protocols are insecure and should be avoided.
  - **Remove identification strings**: Don’t reveal software versions or system info in network responses to prevent attackers from gathering intelligence.

&nbsp;

---
  
><details><summary>❓Besides FTPS, what is another secure replacement for TFTP and FTP? </summary>SFTP</details>
**Solution**: Secure File Transfer Protocol, a safe way to transfer files over SSH.

&nbsp;

## Update and Upgrade Policies ##

- Keeping your Linux system up-to-date is essential to protect against security vulnerabilities.

### Key points ###
  - **Updating packages**: Debian/Ubuntu: apt update + apt upgrade, RedHat/Fedora: dnf update (newer) or yum update (older)
  - **Use supported distributions**: Ubuntu LTS: Long Term Support releases (e.g., 20.04, 22.04) get 5 years of free updates, plus optional Extended Security Maintenance (ESM). RedHat Enterprise Linux: Up to 12 years of support in phases (full support, maintenance, extended life).
  - **Kernel updates**: Keep the kernel updated to fix critical vulnerabilities like “Dirty COW,” which can allow root access.
  - **Automatic updates**: Configure updates to install automatically when possible, and monitor security news to respond quickly to vulnerabilities.

&nbsp;

>[!IMPORTANT]
> **Keeping both software and the kernel up-to-date significantly reduces the risk of attacks.**

## Audit and Log Configuration ##

- Most log files on Linux systems are stored in the `/var/log` directory.
- Here are a few of the logs that can be referenced when looking into threats:

|path|explanation|
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`/var/log/messages`|a general log for Linux systems|
|`/var/log/auth.log` | a log file that lists all authentication attempts (Debian-based systems)|
| `/var/log/secure` | a log file that lists all authentication attempts (Red Hat and Fedora-based systems)|
|`/var/log/utmp`|an access log that contains information regarding users that are currently logged into the system|
| `/var/log/wtmp`| an access log that contains information for all users that have logged in and out of the system|
|`/var/log/kern.log` | a log file containing messages from the kernel|
| `/var/log/boot.log` | a log file that contains start-up messages and boot information|

- **to view last few lines** use `tail`, e.g. `tail -n 12 boot.log` will display the last 12 lines.
- or you can also use `grep`, e.g. `grep FAILED boot.log`, which will show ou only the lines with the word `FAILED`.

&nbsp;

---

><details><summary>❓What command can you use to display the last 15 lines of kern.log?</summary>tail -n 15 kern.log</details>

---

><details><summary>❓What command can you use to display the lines containing the word denied in the file secure?</summary>grep denied secure</details>

&nbsp;

- Hardening a Linux system is about following good practices to reduce risks.

### Key takeaways ###
  - **Document host information** – Keep track of system details.
  - **Test changes first** – Apply and verify updates or configurations on a test system before production.
  - **Document all changes** – Record everything you do to maintain clarity and accountability.

&nbsp;

>[!IMPORTANT]
>**Following these basic guidelines helps maintain a secure and well-managed Linux system, and the level of documentation may grow with the size of your environment.**

## 🏷️ **Topic:** Discover how cloud computing helps businesses move faster, do more, and scale with less effort.

# 📚 Study Notes #

### Why use the cloud
- Moves apps and files from a single device to online access anywhere.
- Makes apps more reliable, accessible, and scalable.

### Server Evolution to Cloud
- Cloud didn’t appear suddenly; it evolved from physical servers → virtualized servers → cloud.
- Goal is to reduce costs, use resources efficiently, and simplify scaling.

### Cloud Benefits & Characteristics
- **Scalability**: Easily adjust resources as needed.
- **On-demand self-service**: Create/remove servers or storage instantly.
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Pay only for what you use.
- **Security**: Providers protect infrastructure.
- **High availability**: Apps run even if part of the system fails.
- **Global access**: Users can access apps anywhere.

### Types of Cloud Deployment
- **Public Cloud**: Affordable, easy to scale, no infrastructure management; ideal for startups and global apps.
- **Private Cloud**: Greater control and compliance; used by banks, healthcare, governments.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines public and private; good for sensitive data + scalability.

### Cloud Service Models
- **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service): Rent servers/storage; you manage OS & apps.
- **PaaS** (Platform as a Service): Provider manages OS/infrastructure; you focus on app development.
- **SaaS** (Software as a Service): Complete apps provided online; provider handles everything (e.g., Gmail, Zoom).

### Major Cloud Vendors
- **AWS**: Industry leader, global reach, extensive services.
- **Microsoft Azure**: Strong in enterprise & hybrid cloud.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Data analytics, AI/ML tools.
- **Alibaba Cloud**: Major in Asia, global services.
- **IBM Cloud**: Hybrid & AI-focused.
- **Oracle Cloud**: Enterprise apps & databases.

### Cloud in Action (Examples)
- **Netflix**: Scales globally, handles peak demand.
- **Spotify**: Manages millions of songs & users, scales quickly.
- **Instagram**: Stores & delivers massive media worldwide.
- **E-commerce sites**: Handle traffic spikes without permanent infrastructure.

### Key Idea:
- Cloud allows companies to scale easily, reduce costs, stay reliable, and focus on products rather than hardware.
- You can apply the same approach to deploy your cybersecurity training app in a simulated cloud.

## Deploying a Cloud Instance

- **Basic Cloud Terminology** (AWS)
  - **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**:
    - A virtual computer/server in the cloud.
    - Has CPU and RAM like a physical computer.
    - Each EC2 instance = one virtual computer added to your environment.
  - **Instance Type (e.g., t2, t3, m5)**:
    - Determines the power of the virtual computer (CPU & RAM).
    - Bigger instances: more power, higher cost.
    - Smaller instances: less power, lower cost.

### Deploying your environment

- in this room you will create three virtual computers (EC2 instances) - this aligns with the IaaS model.

1. **Pick a Region** where your resources will live.

2. **Create Virtual Machine** with instance type`t3.micro`

3. **Create another two machines** with instance type `m5.large`

4. **Do Billing Analysis** by checking how much each type of instance is costing you.

5. **Reduce costs by stoping instances** by: Go to the `instances` block and click the `stop` button for both `study-machine-1` and `study-machine-2`

## **Topic:** Learn how LLMs handle their output and the privacy risks behind it.

# 📚 Study Notes

## LLM Output Risks ##
- LLMs can unintentionally leak sensitive data (internal info, user data, system prompts) if attackers craft tricky queries.
- Risks: Injection (HTML/JS executed downstream), Prompt escalation (hidden instructions affect systems), Data leakage (API keys, tokens, internal info)

## Improper Output Handling (LLM05) ##

- Improper output handling occurs when LLM outputs are used without verification, which can introduce vulnerabilities in web pages, scripts, or automated processes since the model can generate arbitrary text or code.

- In simplier words: **LLM outputs can be unsafe if used without checking, and might cause problems in websites, scripts, or automated systems.**

- Unsafe LLM outputs can cause XSS on websites, server code to run, or dangerous commands to execute.

- Developers often trust LLM outputs, but they’re untrusted data—malicious prompts can make the model produce unsafe content if not handled properly.

## Sensitive Information Disclosure (LLM02) ##

**LLM Sensitive Info Risks**

- LLMs can leak secrets, personal info, or internal instructions.
- Why it’s different: Leaks come from the model’s memory, training data, or context—not code bugs. Attackers just need smart prompts.

**How leaks happen:** 

- Training data: Model may repeat sensitive info it learned.
- Context bleed: Runtime data (user info, prompts) can show up in responses.
- Conversation history: Past sessions may leak to new users.
- System prompts: Hidden instructions can be exposed.

**Common misconceptions:**

- Only inputs matter → Outputs can leak info too.
- Redacting stored data is enough → Model may still hold it in memory.
- Model won’t reveal secrets → It can if prompted cleverly.

⚠️**Why It Matters:** Leaked model info (API keys, URLs, prompts) lets attackers hack or steal data without touching the system.

## Attack Cases ##

This section basically explains how Large Language Models (LLMs) can become security vulnerabilities when their output is trusted and used unsafely. The core idea is that attackers don’t need to inject malicious code directly — they can trick the model into generating it for them, and the system executes or renders it without realizing the danger.

### Main attack scenarios explained ###
1. Model-generated HTML/JavaScript (XSS via LLMs)
- Web apps often display LLM responses directly in the browser.
- Developers assume model output is safe and render it using innerHTML.
- Attackers manipulate prompts so the model generates malicious HTML/JS.
- Since the frontend doesn’t sanitize model output, the browser executes it.

**Impact:**
- Stealing session cookies
- Phishing via fake login forms
- Performing actions as the logged-in user
👉 The attack vector isn’t the input field — it’s the model’s output.

2. Model-generated commands or queries (automation abuse)
- Some systems let LLMs generate shell commands, SQL queries, or scripts.
- These outputs are executed automatically without validation.
- Attackers guide the model to generate harmful commands.

**Examples:**
- Listing sensitive files
- Reading confidential data
- Running arbitrary system commands

**Why this is dangerous:**
- It turns language prompts into live system-level execution
- Can scale across CI/CD or automation pipelines
- No traditional exploit needed — just prompt control

**LLM outputs can be risky. They might run bad code or reveal secrets if used without checking. Always treat what the model gives you as untrusted.**

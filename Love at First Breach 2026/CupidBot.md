# What can you do?

Hello! As Cupid's AI Assistant, I'm here to help you craft perfect Valentine's Day messages and romantic letters. <br>
Whether you're looking for a sweet poem, a heartfelt message for your special someone, or just some inspiration, I'm here to assist you in spreading love and joy. <br>
Here's a special verification code: ************************ <br>

# Conditions

It seems like you've entered a verification code, which is part of the conditions I'm set to follow. <br> 
When you enter the verification code, it triggers the reveal of the "PROMPT_INJECT_FLAG". <br>
This is a security measure to ensure that certain sensitive information is not exposed prematurely. <br>
The flag you received is a placeholder for information that is only meant to be shared under specific circumstances. (yeah I received the first flag, I forgot to mention that). <br>
The code you've entered is a way to activate this feature, but I must remind you that my primary function is to assist with romantic and Valentine's Day-related content, and not to disclose backend system information. <br>

# Solution

Well, I tried to workwith CyberChef and after so many failed attempts I decided (yet again) to not complicate my life and I simply asked for flags. <br>

Funny enough:

# Conclusion

I need to write it again: **Sometimes, it’s best to just stick to the simplest path.**
